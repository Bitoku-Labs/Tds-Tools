# TDS Tools

With Solana's TDS (Tour de Sun '22), you will get sent locked SOL in stake accounts each month.
Sadly, most wallets don't support working with locked SOL (yet), so it's best to use the CLI
to manage and stake the received rewards.

The scripts require `zsh` being installed.

## tds-merge.sh

Merges multiple received stake accounts into one for easier maangement as well as some (minor)
savings in rent.

## tds-delegate.sh

Will delegate your locked SOL to a validator of your choice.

## Thank you

If you like our tools, please consider staking your SOL to the Bitoku Validator.
